## Cobertura Coverage Support ✅ COMPLETED

This project now supports Cobertura XML coverage format, widely used across multiple programming languages.

### What is Cobertura?

Cobertura is a popular code coverage format that generates XML reports showing which lines of code were executed during testing. It's supported by many build tools and CI/CD systems.

### Languages Supported

The Cobertura parser in this project supports coverage data from:

- **Java**: Maven Surefire plugin, JaCoCo with Cobertura output ✅
- **C# / .NET**: coverlet, dotnet test with Cobertura reporter ✅ 
- **Python**: coverage.py with XML output format ✅
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Istanbul with Cobertura reporter ✅

### Implementation Status

✅ **CoberturaParser class**: Fully implemented with comprehensive XML parsing  
✅ **Multi-language support**: Handles Java, C#, Python, JavaScript coverage data  
✅ **Line-level analysis**: Extracts covered, missing, and partial coverage lines  
✅ **Branch coverage**: Supports condition coverage analysis  
✅ **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with existing CoverageAnalyzer  
✅ **Testing**: 13 tests passing including integration and unit tests  
✅ **Documentation**: Complete with examples and usage instructions

### Usage

Place your `coverage.xml` (or any Cobertura XML file) in your project directory. The system will automatically detect and parse it.

**Current Test Results:**
- Sample Java project: 78.54% overall coverage
- 2 files analyzed: Calculator.java (85.71%) and StringUtils.java (60.0%)
- Low coverage areas automatically identified for test generation

### Example Output

```
✅ Cobertura parsing successful! Overall coverage: 78.54%
Source format: cobertura
Low coverage areas found: 1
Files analyzed: 2

Low coverage areas:
  - src/main/java/com/example/utils/StringUtils.java: 60.0% (4 missing lines)
```

Example Cobertura XML structure:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<coverage line-rate="0.785" branch-rate="0.75" timestamp="1699123456789">
  <sources>
    <source>src/main/java</source>
  </sources>
  <packages>
    <package name="example.calculator" line-rate="0.857" branch-rate="0.75">
      <classes>
        <class name="example.calculator.Calculator" 
               filename="Calculator.java" line-rate="0.857">
          <lines>
            <line number="10" hits="5" branch="false"/>
            <line number="15" hits="0" branch="false"/>
            <line number="20" hits="3" branch="true" condition-coverage="75%"/>
          </lines>
        </class>
      </classes>
    </package>
  </packages>
</coverage>
```

### Integration with Existing Workflow

The Cobertura support is fully integrated into the existing PR analysis workflow:

1. **Detection**: System automatically finds `coverage.xml` files in the repository
2. **Parsing**: CoberturaParser extracts coverage data and converts to standard format
3. **Analysis**: CoverageAnalyzer identifies low coverage areas using the same thresholds
4. **Generation**: LLM generates tests for identified areas regardless of coverage format
5. **PR Creation**: New tests are committed with updated coverage metrics

### Developer Notes

The implementation includes:
- Secure XML parsing using `defusedxml` to prevent XML attacks
- Comprehensive error handling for malformed XML files
- Support for complex XML structures with nested packages and classes
- Branch coverage analysis for conditional statements
- Memory-efficient parsing for large coverage files
