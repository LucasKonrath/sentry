# 🔐 Security Configuration Complete

## ✅ Protection Status

Your sensitive API keys are now properly protected:

### 🛡️ What We Secured

1. **Created `.gitignore`** - Prevents `.env` files from being committed
2. **Added `.env.example`** - Template showing required configuration  
3. **Removed API key** from tracked `.env` file
4. **Reset git changes** - Your API key was never committed

### 📋 Next Steps

To continue using Claude for test generation:

1. **Add your API key back to `.env`** (it's now protected):
   ```bash
   # Edit .env and replace:
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
   # With your actual key:
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-your_real_key_here
   ```

2. **The .env file will be ignored** by git going forward

3. **Your API keys are safe** - they won't be committed to the repository

### 🔒 Security Features Added

- `.env` files are now in `.gitignore`
- Virtual environments protected (`.venv/`)  
- Python cache files ignored (`__pycache__/`)
- IDE files ignored (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`)
- Log files ignored (`*.log`)
- Coverage reports ignored
- OS files ignored (`.DS_Store`, etc.)

### ⚠️ Important Reminders

- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- **Use `.env.example`** to show required configuration  
- **Keep `.env` local** for each developer/environment
- **Use different API keys** for development vs production

Your Claude integration is now secure and ready to use! 🎉
