# Security Incident Report

## Issue
API key was accidentally committed to git repository in the following commits:
- `0123cd5` - Contains Anthropic API key in .env file
- Potentially other commits

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Revoke the Exposed API Key
**URGENT**: Go to https://console.anthropic.com/ and immediately:
- Revoke the exposed API key (starts with `sk-ant-api03-...`)
- Generate a new API key
- Update your local `.env` file with the new key

### 2. Clean Git History
The git history contains the API key and should be cleaned before pushing to any remote repository.

## Status
- ✅ API key removed from current files
- ✅ .env files removed from git tracking
- ⚠️  API key still exists in git history (commits `0123cd5`)
- ❌ **API key not yet revoked** - DO THIS FIRST

## Next Steps
1. Revoke the API key immediately
2. Clean git history (see commands below)
3. Generate new API key and update local .env
4. Verify no sensitive data remains in repository

## Git History Cleanup Commands
```bash
# Option 1: Reset to before the API key was added (DESTRUCTIVE)
git reset --hard c4f8be1  # Reset to commit before API key was added

# Option 2: Interactive rebase to edit commits (Advanced)
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Option 3: Start fresh (if this is acceptable)
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with security measures"
```

## Prevention
- .gitignore is now properly configured
- .env.example template created
- Security documentation added
